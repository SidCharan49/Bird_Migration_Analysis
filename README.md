#  Bird Migration Analysis - Power BI Project

This Power BI project analyzes the migration patterns of bird species across global regions using a real dataset.

##  Project Goal
To visualize and extract meaningful insights from bird migration data including speed, regions, flight interruptions, and flock behavior to aid in ecological research.

## Key Insights
- **Top Migration Reasons**: Feeding (25.73%), Breeding (24.36%)
- **Most Tracked Species**: Hawk, Stork, Warbler
- **Journey Interruptions**: Storms (20.59%) and Predators (20.23%)
- **Average Flight Duration**: ~50 hours
- **Total Distance Analyzed**: ~25 million km

## Files Included
- `Bird_Migration_Analysis.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- `Bird_Migration_Analysis.pdf` – Dashboard PDF export
- `bird_migration_data.csv` – Source dataset

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI
- CSV Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Outcomes
This project provides useful insights for ecological planning and wildlife migration protection, helping researchers identify challenges birds face during migration.
